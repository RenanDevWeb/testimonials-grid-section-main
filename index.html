             <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,

              <p>‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.‚Äù</p>

                <p class="black-font font-16"> ‚ÄúBefore joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                  did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                  could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                  100% recommend!‚Äù</p>
